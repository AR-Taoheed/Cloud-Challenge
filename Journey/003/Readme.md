## Introduction

I installed a minikube for running containerized application on my local machine.

## Prerequisite

You need to have either Docker or VirtualBox already preinstalled on your machine.

You can download the minikube.exe or install using admin powershell command on <choco install minikube>


## Next Steps

I intend to deploy my first containerized image tomorrow, absolutely pumped!
